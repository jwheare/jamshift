This Was My Jam is a Spotify app for playing what you and your friends were listening to last year (according to the Last.fm charts).

It's a shameless remixing/theft of the ideas/design behind http://thisismyjam.com and http://twitshift.com

I'll probably rebrand this and package it better for Spotify at some point. You can try it now if you have a Spotify developer account though.

## Installation

* Clone this project into a local `~/Spotify` directory (Mac/Linux) or `My Documents\Spotify` (Windows)
* Change the 'jwheare' username in main.js to your own Last.fm username (need to add localstorage for the username)
* Typing `spotify:app:jamshift` into the search field in Spotify
* Wait for all the data to load (need to add localstorage caching)

You'll probably have to type in the URL every time you relaunch Spotify.
